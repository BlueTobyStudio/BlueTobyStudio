Blue Toby Studio is a casual game studio working on all platforms (mobile, web, pc and console). We try to produce quality games and logic libraries.

## Our vision

For most of the games on the mobile stores, we can clearly see the main reason of the publisher: making money. People forget that games are not products; they are pieces of art. Some will try to promote quantity over quality. That is a sacrifice that we are not ready to make. One sentence can summarize our work: "You either publish something clean, or you don't." Through the internet, published work becomes accessible not only to contemporary users but also serves as a valuable legacy for future generations. A collapsing bridge makes more victims than no bridge at all.

## Next releases

Our team is developing a new puzzle game titled `SONOKLO`. It will launch on Android devices first. Depending on its success, we may release it for Apple products later.
